        " \n",
        "We are using machine learning every day without even noticing it. Probably you are reading this tutorial because search engine algorithm suggested it to you. Few examples of everyday machine learning uses are,\n",
        " \n",
        "* Every time we do Google search, result are not sorted alphabetically or date wise, a machine learning algorithm sorts it based on relevance\n",

        "Unlike traditional fixed rule based programming machine learning is a science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",

        " \n",
        "You must have heard the buzzword **\"Data Is New Oil\"**. So if data is going to be a new oil machine learning is the best tool to make use of exabytes of data generated every day\n",

        " \n",

But if you are beginner, I would recommond you to follow above plan so that you will learn inner workings of every algorithm and it will make huge difference in long run.\n",
